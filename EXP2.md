## TASK 1: [Directory Navigation]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a directory called test_project in your home directory, then create subdirectories docs, scripts, and data inside it. Navigate to the scripts directory and display your current path.]

## Explanation:
* [ Use mkdir to create the wanted directory we can use cd to navigate and use pwd to show current path ]

## Command(s):
''' 
mkdir test_project
cd test_project 
mkdir docs scripts data
cd scripts 
pwd
'''

## TASK 2: [FIle Creation and Content]

## Task Statement:
* [Create three files in the docs directory: readme.txt, notes.txt, and todo.txt. Add the text "Project documentation" to readme.txt and "Important notes" to notes.txt. Display the contents of both files.]

## Explanation:
* [We can use touch to create empty files and using echo "text" > file.txt to add content to a file and using cat to display file contents]

## Command(s):
```
cd docs 
touch readme.txt notes.txt todo.txt 
echo "Project documentation" > readme.txt
echo "Important notes" > notes.txt
cat notes.txt
cat readme.txt

```

### Output:
<img width="874" height="697" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-05 222519" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33573ef5-3e25-444b-9b28-fe0fcb4f5c46" />



## TASK 3: [FIle Operations]

## Task Statement:
* [Copy readme.txt to the data directory and rename the copy to project_info.txt. Then move todo.txt from docs to scripts directory.]

## Explanation:
* [- We can use the cp source destination to copy files and using the mv oldname newname to rename files also using the same command mv file directory/ to move files to another directory we can also combine copy and rename: cp file.txt newdir/newname.txt]


## Command(s):
```
cp readme.txt data/project_info.txt

```

### Output:
<img width="879" height="996" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-05 223450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8ddc16a-afcf-404b-a029-d73c54cb1449" />



## TASK 4: [FIle Permissions]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a shell script file called backup.sh in the scripts directory. Add the content #!/bin/bash and echo "Backup complete" to it. Make the file executable only for the owner.]

## Explanation:
* [Using chmod u+x filename we can make the file executable for user only using ls -l to check for permissions also script files typically need executable permission to run]

## Command(s):
```
cd scripts 
touch backup.sh > echo "Backup complete"
chmod u+x backup.sh

```

### Output:
<img width="643" height="435" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-05 225800" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce28a29-943c-4c8c-871f-a6c560f2298c" />



## TASK 5: [FIle Viewing]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a file called numbers.txt with numbers 1 to 20 (each on a new line). Display only the first 5 lines, then only the last 3 lines, then search for lines containing the number "1".]

## Explanation:
*  [ I can quickly generate a list of numbers by running seq 1 20 > numbers.txt. To check the first few numbers, I use head -n 5 to see the first 5 lines, and tail -n 3 to see the last 3 lines. If I want to find all numbers containing a “1”, I can use grep "1". Alternatively, I could create the list manually by using multiple echo commands.]

## Command(s):
```
seq 1 20 > numbers.txt
head -n 5
tail -n 3
grep "1"

```

### Output:
<img width="647" height="442" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-05 233744" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e2ec0f5-8cd8-4cac-8476-8035ca2940b8" />



## TASK 6: [Text Editing]

## Task Statement:
* [Using nano, create a file called config.txt with the following content:

Database=localhost Port=5432 Username=admin <pre></pre> Save the file and then display its contents.]

## Explanation:
* [I open a file in Nano using nano filename.txt and type my content normally. Once I’m done, I press Ctrl+O to save the file and Ctrl+X to exit Nano. After that, I use cat to check the contents and make sure everything was saved correctly.]

## Command(s):
```
vim config.txt
cat config.txt

```
#### Alternatively 

```
nano config.txt
cat config.txt

```


### Output:
<img width="642" height="439" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-05 234435" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc29120-13a3-4122-9641-51e8d0dc37f2" />



## TASK 7: [System Information]

## Task Statement:
* [Create a file called system_info.txt that contains: your username, current date, your current directory, and disk usage information in human-readable format.
]

## Explanation:
* [I can use whoami to check my username, date to see the current date, and pwd to know my current directory. To check disk usage, I use df -h. I can save the output of any command to a file by using redirection like command >> filename.txt. If I want to add labels, I use echo like this: echo "Username:" >> file.txt.]

## Command(s):
```
cd scripts
touch system_info.txt
echo "Username:" >> system_info.txt
whoami >> system_info.txt
echo "Date:" >> system_info.txt
date >> system_info.txt
echo "Current Directory:" >> system_info.txt
pwd >> system_info.txt
echo "Disk Usage:" >> system_info.txt
df -h >> system_info.txt

```

## TASK 8: [File Organisation]

## Task Statement:
* [In your test_project directory, create a backup folder. Copy all .txt files from all subdirectories into this backup folder. Then list all files in the backup folder with detailed information.
]

## Explanation:
* [I can use find . -name "*.txt" to locate all .txt files. Alternatively, I can navigate to each directory and copy files manually. To copy multiple files at once, I use cp file1.txt file2.txt destination/. If I want detailed information about the files, I use ls -la. The wildcard *.txt helps me match all files that end with .txt.]

## Command(s):
```
cp test_project/data/project_info.txt    test_project/docs/notes.txt    test_project/docs/readme.txt    test_project/docs/todo.txt    test_project/scripts/config.txt    test_project/scripts/numbers.txt    test_project/scripts/system_info.txt    test_project/scripts/todo.txt    backup/

```

### Output:
<img width="877" height="161" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-05 235943" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82519126-b076-4642-a02b-3e13c3817c69" />

## TASK 9: [Process and History]

## Task Statement:
* [Display your command history and count how many commands you've executed. Then show the top 10 most recent commands.
]

## Explanation:
* [I can use history to see all the commands I’ve typed. To count the total number of commands, I use history | wc -l. If I want to view just the last 10 commands, I can use history 10 or history | tail -10. The wc -l command simply counts the number of lines in the output.]

## Command(s):
```
history 10
```

### Output:
<img width="883" height="635" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-06 000240" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3259fdd3-a8d1-4698-beda-9af683c02ced" />


## TASK 10: [Comprehensive Cleanup]

## Task Statement:
* [Set the permissions of your backup.sh script to be readable, writable, and executable by owner, readable and executable by group, and readable by others. Then create a summary file that lists the total number of files and directories in your entire test_project.]

## Explanation:
* [I can set permissions for backup.sh using chmod 754 backup.sh to give rwxr-xr-- permissions. Alternatively, I can use chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r backup.sh. To count all files, I use find . -type f | wc -l, and to count directories, I use find . -type d | wc -l. If I want to see the full directory structure recursively, I use ls -R. I can also combine multiple commands with && or save the outputs to a summary file for later reference.]

## Command(s):
```
chmod 754 backup.sh


echo "Total files:" > summary.txt
find . -type f | wc -l >> summary.txt
echo "Total directories:" >> summary.txt
find . -type d | wc -l >> summary.txt


```

### Output:
<img width="856" height="632" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-06 000645" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de320063-05c4-4e69-8540-4a422eca7a96" />



## Result

* Successfully created, copied, moved, and deleted files.
* Practiced viewing file contents and monitoring logs.
* Explored file permissions and ownership management.
* Used `find` and `grep` to locate and filter data.
* Created archives and compressed files.
* Demonstrated both hard and symbolic links.

## Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes

* Challenge 1: Accidentally deleted files with `rm` without `-i`. Learned to use `rm -i` for safety.
* Challenge 2: Remembering numeric vs symbolic permissions in `chmod`. Fixed through repeated practice.

### Learning:

* Gained practical skills with file manipulation and permission commands.
* Learned how to efficiently search files and patterns in Linux.
* Understood how to archive and compress files for better storage management.
* Understood differences between hard and symbolic links.

## Conclusion

This experiment provided hands-on experience with core Linux file management, permissions, searching, archiving, and linking. These are foundational skills for effective Linux system administration and daily usage.
